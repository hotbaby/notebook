    "* Complex is better than complicated.\n",

    "* Readability counts.\n",
    "* Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.\n",
    "* Although practicality beats purity.\n",
    "* Errors should never pass silently.\n",
    "* Unless explicitly silenced.\n",
    "* In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.\n",
    "* There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.\n",
    "* Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.\n",
    "* Now is better than never.\n",
    "* Although never is often better than *right* now.\n",
    "* If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.\n",
    "* If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.\n",
    "* Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!"
